# Architecture 

### 1. Model

**Overview:**
The foundational level where a trained model (e.g., OpenAI GPT model) is initialized. It's the base on which further abstraction levels build upon. It provides the core capabilities to perform tasks, answer queries, etc.

### 2. Agent Level

**Overview:**
At the agent level, the raw model is coupled with tools and a vector store, allowing it to be more than just a model. The agent can now remember, use tools, and become a more versatile entity ready for integration into larger systems.

**Diagram:**
```
+-----------+
|   Agent   |
| +-------+ |
| | Model | |
| +-------+ |
| +-----------+ |
| | VectorStore | |
| +-----------+ |
| +-------+ |
| | Tools | |
| +-------+ |
+-----------+
```

### 3. Worker Infrastructure Level

**Overview:**
The worker infrastructure is a step above individual agents. Here, an agent is paired with additional utilities like human input and other tools, making it a more advanced, responsive unit capable of complex tasks.

**Diagram:**
```
+----------------+
|  WorkerNode    |
| +-----------+  |
| |   Agent   |  |
| | +-------+ |  |
| | | Model | |  |
| | +-------+ |  |
| | +-------+ |  |
| | | Tools | |  |
| | +-------+ |  |
| +-----------+  |
|                |
| +-----------+  |
| |Human Input|  |
| +-----------+  |
|                |
| +-------+      |
| | Tools |      |
| +-------+      |
+----------------+
```

### 4. Swarm Level

**Overview:**
At the swarm level, multiple worker nodes (agents) are orchestrated together. The orchestrator manages the swarm, ensuring distributed tasking, efficient load balancing, and communication between agents. It is akin to how orchestration tools like Kubernetes manage containers.

**Diagram:**
```
        +------------+
        |Orchestrator|
        +------------+
             /   \
  +----------------+   +----------------+
  |  WorkerNode    |   |  WorkerNode    |
  |                |   |                |
  +----------------+   +----------------+
          .                     .
          .                     .
          .                     .
  +----------------+   +----------------+
  |  WorkerNode    |   |  WorkerNode    |
  |                |   |                |
  +----------------+   +----------------+
```

### 5. Hivemind Level

**Overview:**
The hivemind represents the zenith of this abstraction. Here, multiple swarms are coordinated together, forming a mega-structure. This configuration is best for highly complex tasks that require vast computational power and parallelism.

**Diagram:**
```
             +--------+
             |Hivemind|
             +--------+
                 |
            +------------+
            |Orchestrator|
            +------------+
                 /   \
  +----------------+   +----------------+
  |    Swarm       |   |    Swarm       |
  +----------------+   +----------------+
      /    \               /     \
+--------+ +--------+  +--------+ +--------+
|Worker  | |Worker  |  |Worker  | |Worker  |
| Node   | | Node   |  | Node   | | Node   |
+--------+ +--------+  +--------+ +--------+
```

With these abstractions, the architecture allows for scalable and distributed operations, making it adaptable for varied complexities of tasks.
