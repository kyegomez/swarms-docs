# Architecture 

### 1. Model

**Overview:**
The foundational level where a trained model (e.g., OpenAI GPT model) is initialized. It's the base on which further abstraction levels build upon. It provides the core capabilities to perform tasks, answer queries, etc.

**Diagram:**

### 2. Agent Level

**Overview:**
At the agent level, the raw model is coupled with tools and a vector store, allowing it to be more than just a model. The agent can now remember, use tools, and become a more versatile entity ready for integration into larger systems.

**Diagram:**
```
+-----------+
|   Agent   |
| +-------+ |
| | Model | |
| +-------+ |
| +-----------+ |
| | VectorStore | |
| +-----------+ |
| +-------+ |
| | Tools | |
| +-------+ |
+-----------+
```

### 3. Worker Infrastructure Level

**Overview:**
The worker infrastructure is a step above individual agents. Here, an agent is paired with additional utilities like human input and other tools, making it a more advanced, responsive unit capable of complex tasks.

**Diagram:**
```
+----------------+
|  WorkerNode    |
| +-----------+  |
| |   Agent   |  |
| | +-------+ |  |
| | | Model | |  |
| | +-------+ |  |
| | +-------+ |  |
| | | Tools | |  |
| | +-------+ |  |
| +-----------+  |
|                |
| +-----------+  |
| |Human Input|  |
| +-----------+  |
|                |
| +-------+      |
| | Tools |      |
| +-------+      |
+----------------+
```

### 4. Swarm Level

**Overview:**
At the swarm level, the orchestrator is central. It's responsible for assigning tasks to worker nodes, monitoring their completion, and handling the communication layer (for example, through a vector store or another universal communication mechanism) between worker nodes.

**Diagram:**
```
                     +------------+
                     |Orchestrator|
                     +------------+
                           |
            +---------------------------+
            |                           |
            |   Swarm-level Communication|
            |          Layer (e.g.      |
            |        Vector Store)      |
            +---------------------------+
             /          |          \         
  +---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+
  |WorkerNode 1   |  |WorkerNode 2   |  |WorkerNode n   |
  |               |  |               |  |               |
  +---------------+  +---------------+  +---------------+
   | Task Assigned   | Task Completed   | Communication |
```

### 5. Hivemind Level

**Overview:**
At the Hivemind level, it's a multi-swarm setup, with an upper-layer orchestrator managing multiple swarm-level orchestrators. The Hivemind orchestrator is responsible for broader tasks like assigning macro-tasks to swarms, handling inter-swarm communications, and ensuring the overall system is functioning smoothly.

**Diagram:**
```
                     +--------+
                     |Hivemind|
                     +--------+
                         |
                 +--------------+
                 |Hivemind      |
                 |Orchestrator  |
                 +--------------+
            /         |          \         
    +------------+  +------------+  +------------+
    |Orchestrator|  |Orchestrator|  |Orchestrator|
    +------------+  +------------+  +------------+
        |               |               |
+--------------+ +--------------+ +--------------+
|   Swarm-level| |   Swarm-level| |   Swarm-level|
|Communication| |Communication| |Communication|
|    Layer    | |    Layer    | |    Layer    |
+--------------+ +--------------+ +--------------+
    /    \         /    \         /     \
+-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+
|Worker | |Worker | |Worker | |Worker | |Worker |
| Node  | | Node  | | Node  | | Node  | | Node  |
+-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+ +-------+
```

This setup allows the Hivemind level to operate at a grander scale, with the capability to manage hundreds or even thousands of worker nodes across multiple swarms efficiently.
