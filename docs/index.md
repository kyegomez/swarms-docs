# Swarms Docs

Welcome to Swarms Docs!

This documentation covers the fundamentals of the **Swarms** framework and describes how to use **Swarms Tools**.

## Swarms

The Swarms framework provides developers with the ability to create AI systems that operate across two dimensions: predictability and creativity. For predictability, Swarms enforces structures like sequential pipelines, DAG-based workflows, and long-term memory. To facilitate creativity, Swarms safely prompts LLMs with [tools](https://github.com/swarms-ai/swarms-tools) and short-term memory connecting them to external APIs and data stores. The framework allows developers to transition between those two dimensions effortlessly based on their use case.

Swarms not only helps developers harness the potential of LLMs but also enforces trust boundaries, schema validation, and tool activity-level permissions. By doing so, Swarms maximizes LLMs’ reasoning while adhering to strict policies regarding their capabilities.
